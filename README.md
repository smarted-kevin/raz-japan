**Things I want to work on next**

*STRIPE*
[x] - Course: add course to stripe on new course creation
[x] - Course: add stripe product and price IDs to course on course creation
[x] - User: add user to stripe and stripe_id to user on first user purchase
[x] - Add readable order number column to full_order table and append the order number to the stripe payment metadata


*UI*
[x] - Add sign-up link to top nav (if no user signed in)
[ ] - Member page layout - mockup and code
      [ ] - Navbar (profile, students, order history)
[ ] - Dashboard top page:
      [ ] - Summary section (total students, total classrooms, notifications, etc.)
      [ ] - Left sidebar??

[ ] - Classroom dashboard page showing the following:
      [x] - Summary of students (active, inactive) at top
      [x] - List of active students and inactive students
      [x] - "Add Students" functionality
[ ] - Fill out Japanese on member pages and order pages

**CURRENT ISSUES**

[x] - Session issues when going to from "userDropdown" when admin user is already logged in on top page or sign in page
[x] - Renewal student expiry date not changing on renewal (when expiry date is null) -- Users now cannot renew students unless within 2 months of current renewal date, which resolves this issue.
[x] - Dropdown "Go to dashboard" only handles user redirect, need to add admin redirect
