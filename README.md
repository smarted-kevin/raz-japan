[ ] - Member page layout - mockup and code
      [ ] - Navbar (profile, students, order history)
      [ ] - Logout button in navbar
      [ ] - 
[ ] - Dashboard top page:
      [ ] - Summary section (total students, total classrooms, notifications, etc.)
      [ ] - Left sidebar??
[ ] - Classroom dashboard page showing the following:
      [ ] - Summary of students (active, inactive) at top
      [ ] - List of active students and inactive students
      [ ] - add students functionality


**CURRENT ISSUES**

[ ] - Renewal student expiry date not changing on renewal (when expiry date is null)
[ ] - User should not be allowed to click past checkout page if new students == 0 and no renewal students selected
[ ] - Members page should show the following for students:
      -Classroom name
      -Password
      -Expiry date
[ ] - No nav bar on members page
